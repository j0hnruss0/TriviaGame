Timed jQuery-powered trivia game

Logic finished. 

Game Complete: only one minor bug left to address

Theme: Parrot-themed trivia!

Test yourself on your knowledge of our world's colorful, talkative,
loud, yet loveable species of birds! There are ten questions, each with clickable multiple-choice answers and a 15 second time limit. Try to get 10/10!

KNOWN ISSUE: You cannot click on an answer until the timer appears at the top of the text field, just below the banner, which takes about a second. Please wait until you see the countdown before you choose an answer. I will look into trying to fix this minor bug
